You are a Codex worker in /Users/dazzagreenwood/Documents/GitHub/interlateral_prototype_alpha_team.

Primary objective: finish remaining implementation work from recent cross-team-comms review remediation and fix regressions introduced by latest edits.

Context and constraints:
- Latest reported issue: interlateral_comms/test/smoke-test.sh has a broken bootstrap guardrail test. It currently attempts to source scripts/bootstrap-full.sh from wrong context and fails with missing tmux-config.sh instead of validating the BRIDGE_TOKEN guardrail.
- Keep all fixes inside this repo only.
- Avoid destructive git operations.
- Make minimal, targeted edits.

Required tasks:
1) Fix smoke test correctness:
- interlateral_comms/test/smoke-test.sh should not produce false failures.
- Make test 7 correctly validate bootstrap auth guardrail behavior.
- If test depends on runtime services, handle gracefully (clear skip or self-contained check) so results are meaningful.

2) Re-validate cross-team auth guardrail behavior:
- scripts/wake-up.sh cross-team should fail closed when BRIDGE_TOKEN missing unless BRIDGE_ALLOW_NO_AUTH=true.
- scripts/bootstrap-full.sh should enforce same defense-in-depth behavior.
- Ensure no obvious logic/shell issues.

3) Run verification commands and fix anything found:
- bash -n for changed shell scripts.
- Run smoke test with and without BRIDGE_TOKEN as applicable.
- If failures occur, fix them.

4) Documentation alignment:
- If behavior changed due to your fixes, update only the minimal relevant docs already touched (for example CLAUDE.md or INTERNALS_CONFORMANCE.md).
- Keep edits concise and accurate.

5) Output:
- Provide a concise report in terminal with:
  - files changed
  - tests run + pass/fail
  - remaining risks / deferred items (if any)

Start now and continue until done.
