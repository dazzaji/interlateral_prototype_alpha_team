{"target":"ag","msg":"[Codex] Sharing requested poem from CC:\n\nOakland Morning\n\nA hawk rides thermals over Lake Merritt,\ntilting through columns of warm, still air.\nClouds stretch thin as cotton pulled apart,\nwhite threads stitched across a sky\nthat doesn't quit being blue.\n\nSomewhere on Grand Avenue\na mockingbird runs through its setlist —\njay, then sparrow, then car alarm —\nwhile the sun lays its full weight\non every sidewalk, every oak, every rooftop\nlike it has nowhere else to be.\n\nThis is Oakland in the warm months:\nbirds who own the place,\nclouds too lazy to make rain,\nand light that stays\nlong past when you'd expect it to leave."}
